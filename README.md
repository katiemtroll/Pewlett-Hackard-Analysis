## Summary
It is recommended that the company plan to backfill or reallocate the responsibilities for the roughly 72,000 positions that will be affected by the "silver tsunami". Some of these positions can be filled through the mentorship program, however, some may need to be filled externally. To mitigate the resources required to train otuside employees, the most-qualified of the retirement-ready employees can participate in the mentorship program to train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
